# How Payments Work on Shakers

**Title**: Payments Guide
**Topic**: Payments

At Shakers, our payment system is designed to be secure, transparent, and simple for both clients and freelancers. All payments are processed through our platform to ensure protection.

When a client hires a freelancer, they fund an escrow account. This means the money is held securely by Shakers until the project milestones are met and approved by the client. This protects clients by ensuring they only pay for work they approve, and it protects freelancers by ensuring the funds are available before they begin working.
