# Implementation: The Conversational Chain

## 1. Overview
While ingestion prepares the data, the Conversational Retrieval Chain is the live, operational heart of the chatbot. This chain, defined in `main.py` as the `rag_chain` object, orchestrates the entire process of receiving a user's query, understanding its context from the conversation history, retrieving relevant information, and generating a final, cited answer. This is not a simple question-answering system; it is designed to be fully conversational and context-aware.

## 2. Step 1: Handling Conversational Context (`HistoryAwareRetriever`)
A key requirement is the ability to handle follow-up questions. A user must be able to ask "Why?" and have the chatbot understand what "that" refers to. This is achieved by the first part of our chain, the `create_history_aware_retriever`.

*   **How it Works:** This component's sole purpose is to rephrase a potentially ambiguous follow-up question into a complete, standalone query. It uses its own dedicated LLM prompt (`recontextualization_prompt`) which is given the chat history and the new question. It then instructs the LLM to generate the rephrased question.
*   **Example in Action:**
    1.  **User:** "Tell me about the Parent Document Retriever."
    2.  **Assistant:** *(Gives a detailed explanation...)*
    3.  **User:** "Why is it better than basic splitting?"
    4.  **Internal Rephrasing:** The `HistoryAwareRetriever` internally generates a new, complete query: **"Why is the Parent Document Retriever better than basic text splitting strategies?"** This standalone question is then passed to the next stage.
*   **Design Rationale:** This state management is essential for a natural user experience. Without it, every user query would be treated in isolation, making fluid conversation impossible and forcing the user to repeat themselves.

## 3. Step 2: Retrieving Documents (`ParentDocumentRetriever`)
The rephrased, standalone question from Step 1 is then used to retrieve information from our indexed knowledge base.

*   **Component Used:** The `ParentDocumentRetriever` instance we configured during the ingestion phase.
*   **What it Does:** It takes the rephrased query, embeds it using the `models/embedding-001` model, and performs a similarity search in the `FAISS` vector store to find the most relevant *child chunks*. It then retrieves the corresponding larger *parent chunks* from the `InMemoryStore` and passes these along to the final stage.

## 4. Step 3: Generating a Cited and Accurate Answer (`create_stuff_documents_chain`)
This is the final and most critical step, where the retrieved context is used to generate the assistant's response.

*   **The Component:** We use `langchain.chains.create_stuff_documents_chain`, which "stuffs" all the retrieved parent chunks into a single prompt.
*   **The System Prompt: A Contract for Reliability:** The prompt (`qa_prompt` in `main.py`) provided to the `gemini-1.5-flash` model is not a suggestion; it is a strict set of rules the LLM **must** follow. This is our primary mechanism for ensuring the chatbot is trustworthy and does not "hallucinate." Key rules include:
    > 1.  Synthesize the information from the context to provide a clear, concise answer.
    > 2.  **Strict Context Adherence:** Your entire response must be synthesized *exclusively* from the information within the provided CONTEXT. Do not use any external knowledge.
    > 3.  **Citation Process:** You MUST include a `Sources:` section at the end of your response, mapping a citation number to the topic name from the document's metadata.
    > 4.  **Uncertainty Protocol:** If the answer is not found in the context, you MUST respond with: "I'm sorry, I don't have enough information to answer that question based on the provided documents."
*   **Design Rationale:** These rules directly address core challenges in applied LLMs. Rule 2 prevents made-up facts. Rule 3 provides **verifiability**, allowing the evaluator to trace every claim back to its source document. Rule 4 provides **graceful failure**, preventing the bot from guessing. This prompt engineering is what elevates the system from a simple text generator to a reliable assistant.
