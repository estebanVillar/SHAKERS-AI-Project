# Concept: LLMs and Google Gemini

## 1. The Analogy: A Language Engine
Think of a Large Language Model (LLM) as a highly advanced text engine. You feed it a sequence of words (a "prompt"), and it performs one, incredibly complex task: **it predicts the next most likely word**. It then adds that word to the sequence and repeats the process, generating text one word at a time.

Through training on a massive corpus of text and code from the internet, it has learned the patterns, grammar, syntax, context, and even reasoning structures of human language. This allows it to do more than just complete sentences; it can answer questions, summarize text, translate languages, and write code.

## 2. Key Concepts in Using LLMs

### 2.1. The Prompt
The **prompt** is the single most important input you give an LLM. It is not just a question; it is a set of instructions. A well-crafted prompt, often called "prompt engineering," guides the model to produce the desired output. In our project, the system prompt in `main.py` is a detailed contract that tells the LLM exactly how to behave: how to cite sources, what to do if it doesn't know the answer, and what persona to adopt.

### 2.2. Temperature
Temperature is a setting that controls the "creativity" or randomness of an LLM's output.
*   **Low Temperature (e.g., 0.1 - 0.3):** The model becomes more deterministic and "focused." It will always choose the most likely next word. This is ideal for factual tasks like question-answering based on a provided context, where we want reliable and consistent answers. **Our project uses a low temperature of `0.2` for this reason.**
*   **High Temperature (e.g., 0.7 - 1.0):** The model is allowed to choose less likely words, increasing randomness and creativity. This is better for tasks like writing poetry or brainstorming marketing slogans.

### 2.3. The Context Window
The context window is the maximum amount of text (input prompt + generated output) the model can "remember" at one time. If the input prompt is longer than the context window, the model will forget the earliest parts of the text. For our RAG system, it's crucial to use a model with a large enough context window to fit our system prompt plus all the retrieved document chunks. `gemini-1.5-flash` was chosen partly for its very large context window.

## 3. Our Choice: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash
For this project, we chose `gemini-1.5-flash` as our core reasoning engine for several key reasons:

*   **Performance:** As its name suggests, "Flash" is optimized for very low latency, which is critical for a responsive chatbot experience and meeting the case study's requirement of a sub-5-second response time.
*   **Long Context Window:** It has a massive context window (up to 1 million tokens), meaning we don't have to worry about running out of space when we "stuff" our RAG documents into the prompt.
*   **High Capability:** Despite its speed, it maintains a very high level of reasoning and language understanding, making it perfect for synthesizing complex information from our documentation.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** It provides an excellent balance of performance and cost, making it a sustainable choice for a real-world application.
