# Handling Disputes on Shakers

**Title**: Dispute Resolution Process
**Topic**: Disputes

While rare, disagreements can happen. Shakers offers a clear dispute resolution process. If a client is unsatisfied with the work, or a freelancer has not been paid for approved work, they can initiate a dispute. Our support team will mediate the situation by reviewing the project scope, communications, and deliverables to reach a fair resolution. We recommend clear communication throughout the project to prevent disputes.
