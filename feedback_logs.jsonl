It serves as the project's Vector Store [1]. FAISS is not a general-purpose database; it is specifically designed for the task of finding similar vectors [1]. It performs an **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** search to overcome the speed limitations of a brute-force search, which would be too slow for large knowledge bases [2]. During retrieval, the `ParentDocumentRetriever` passes the user's vectorized query to the loaded FAISS index's `similarity_search()` method, and FAISS uses its optimized ANN algorithm to return the `k` most similar child chunks instantly [2]. This makes the \"Retrieve\" part of the \"Retrieve-Augment-Generate\" pipeline exceptionally fast, enabling a fluid, real-time conversational experience [2].\n\nSources:\n1.
