Think of it like giving a research librarian the ability to answer questions using a library, rather than relying on memory alone [1].\n\nRAG addresses the \"knowledge boundary problem\" [2]. LLMs have a static knowledge base from their training data, making them unaware of private data, recent events, or specific documentation [2]. RAG bridges this gap by providing a dynamic connection to external information, enabling the LLM to answer questions without retraining [2].\n\nThe RAG process involves three key steps [3]:\n\n1.  **Retrieve:** The system uses the user's query to search for relevant document chunks from the knowledge base [3].\n2.  **Augment:** The system creates a prompt for the LLM that includes the retrieved text chunks and the user's question [3].\n3.  **Generate:** The LLM uses the augmented prompt to generate a factual and context-aware response [3]. The LLM is instructed to only use the provided documents [3]. This helps to avoid \"hallucinations,\" where the LLM generates plausible but incorrect information [3].\n\nRAG is a cost-effective and maintainable choice, especially when needing to answer questions based on a specific and evolving set of documents [4]. It gives the LLM new knowledge without changing its core skills [4].\n\nSources:\n1. Concept: Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n2.

It addresses the trade-off between precision, context, and cost when choosing the size of document chunks [1].\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1.  **Splitting:** The strategy uses two text splitters: a `child_splitter` that creates small, precise chunks (chunk\\_size=400, chunk\\_overlap=50) and a `parent_splitter` that creates larger, more context-rich chunks (chunk\\_size=2000, chunk\\_overlap=200) [1].\n2.  **Indexing:** Only the small \"child chunks\" are embedded using `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` and indexed in a `FAISS` vector store for efficient and precise search [1].\n3.  **Storage:** The larger \"parent chunks\" are stored in an `InMemoryStore`, which maps a unique ID to the full text of each parent chunk [1].\n4.  **Retrieval:** When a query comes in, the system finds the most relevant child chunks using the `FAISS` vector store and then retrieves the corresponding parent chunks from the `InMemoryStore` [1]. This provides the LLM with enough context to formulate a high-quality answer [1].\n\nThis approach allows for precise search using small chunks while providing the LLM with the broader context from the larger parent chunks, leading to better answers [1].\n\nSources:\n1. 04_02-Implementation-Parent-Document-Retriever", "sources": ["04_01-Implementation-Ingestation-and-Indexing", "04_02-Implementation-Parent-Document-Retreiver", "04_03-Implementation-Conversational-Chain"], "latency_ms": 3191, "input_tokens": 3814, "output_tokens": 343, "total_tokens": 4157, "cost": 0.00169505}

This request includes the user's `query`, a unique `user_id`, and the `chat_history` [1]. The main job of the `/api/query` endpoint is to call `rag_chain.invoke()` and then orchestrate the `_update_user_profile` and `log_query` utility functions [1]. If the RAG chain returns a \"not found\" message, the endpoint invokes a separate LLM chain to suggest relevant alternative questions [1]. Finally, the endpoint returns a JSON response containing the AI-generated `answer` with in-text citations and a list of `sources` [1]. For a complete understanding of the data flow, diving into `01-Flow-Lifecycle-of-a-Query.md` is highly recommended [1].\n\nSources:\n1.

Because Streamlit scripts rerun on almost every user interaction, `st.session_state` acts like memory, persisting data across these reruns for the duration of a user's browser session [2]. It helps in remembering the user's ID, current chat, and entire chat history, which is crucial for a seamless chat application [1]. The application uses session state to keep track of chat histories, the current user's ID, and which page is being viewed across browser sessions and reruns [1].\n\nSources:\n1.
